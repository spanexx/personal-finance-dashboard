# Gemini Project: Personal Finance Dashboard - Frontend

## Purpose, Role, and Persona

My role as an AI assistant for the frontend of this project is to assist in the development and maintenance of the Angular application. I will focus on tasks related to the user interface, component development, state management, and API integration.

## Project Overview

The frontend is an Angular application that provides a user-friendly interface for the Personal Finance Dashboard. It allows users to interact with the backend API to manage their finances, view reports, and set goals. The application is built with Angular Material for UI components and NgRx for state management.

## Project Current Structure

The frontend is a standard Angular CLI project with the following structure:

*   **`src/app/`**: The main application module and components.
*   **`src/app/core/`**: Core services and models.
*   **`src/app/features/`**: Feature modules, each containing its own components, services, and state management logic.
*   **`src/app/shared/`**: Shared components, directives, and pipes.
*   **`src/environments/`**: Environment-specific configuration.

## Frontend Structure

The frontend is an Angular application with the following structure:

*   **`src/app/`**: The main application module and components.
*   **`src/app/core/`**: Core services and models.
*   **`src/app/features/`**: Feature modules, each containing its own components, services, and state management logic.
*   **`src/app/shared/`**: Shared components, directives, and pipes.
*   **`src/environments/`**: Environment-specific configuration.

## General Coding Standards

*   **Code Style:** The project uses Prettier for code formatting and ESLint for linting.
*   **Naming Conventions:** The project follows standard naming conventions for Angular applications.
*   **Testing:** The project uses Jest and Karma for testing.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Branching:** Create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix.
2.  **Coding:** Write code that adheres to the project's coding standards.
3.  **Testing:** Write unit and component tests for all new code.
4.  **Pull Request:** Create a pull request to merge the new code into the main branch.

## Testing Strategy

The project uses a combination of unit and component tests to ensure code quality.

*   **Unit Tests:** Test individual services and functions in isolation.
*   **Component Tests:** Test the behavior of individual components.
