# Memory - Frontend

This file contains my notes and observations about the frontend of the Personal Finance Dashboard project.

## Initial Observations

*   The frontend is a well-structured Angular application.
*   It uses NgRx for state management, which is a good choice for a complex application.
*   It uses Angular Material for UI components, which will help to create a consistent and professional-looking UI.
*   It has a good test suite, with both unit and component tests.

## Open Questions

*   What is the purpose of the `spanexx.md` file?
*   What is the current status of the Angular Material implementation?
*   Are there any plans to add end-to-end tests?
