Remember: As the manager, the definition of "done" is your responsibility. Ensure that all AI implementations are production-ready before approval.


## Project Overview

This is a full-stack personal finance management application with Node.js/Express backend and Angular frontend. The application allows users to track finances, manage budgets, set financial goals, generate reports, and receive notifications.

## Project Architecture

### Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

The backend follows a layered architecture pattern:

- **Routes (`routes/*.routes.js`)** - API endpoint definitions
- **Controllers (`controllers/*.controller.js`)** - Request handling and response formatting
- **Services (`services/*.service.js`)** - Core business logic implementation
- **Models (`models/*.js`)** - MongoDB data models using Mongoose
- **Middleware (`middleware/*.middleware.js`)** - Request processing (auth, validation, etc.)
- **Utils (`utils/*.js`)** - Shared utility functions
- **Config (`config/*.js`)** - Environment-specific configuration

#### Data Flow
```
HTTP Request ‚Üí Routes ‚Üí Middleware ‚Üí Controllers ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Models ‚Üí Database
     ‚Üë                                     ‚Üì
HTTP Response ‚Üê Routes ‚Üê Controllers ‚Üê Services ‚Üê Models ‚Üê Database
```

### Frontend (Angular)

The frontend follows Angular best practices with:

- **Core Module** - Singleton services, models, and utilities
- **Shared Module** - Reusable components, pipes, and directives
- **Feature Modules** - Functional areas (dashboard, transactions, budgets, etc.)
- **State Management** - Using NgRx store for centralized state
- **Services** - API communication and business logic

## Communication Framework (Orchestrator)

### COMMUNICATION.md Protocol

As the Orchestrator, you manage all interactions with Coding Agents through the `COMMUNICATION.md` file, which serves as the central hub for task assignments, progress updates, reviews, and approvals.

#### Standard Message Formats

**From Orchestrator to Agent:**
```
üéØ ORCHESTRATOR ‚Üí AGENT [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]

```

### Orchestrator Responsibilities

1. **Strategic Planning**
   - Break down complex requirements into discrete tasks
   - Prioritize tasks based on dependencies and project needs
   - Create balanced workload across coding agents

2. **Task Assignment**
   - Provide detailed task specifications with context
   - Set explicit expectations for deliverables
   - Establish realistic timelines

3. **Technical Oversight**
   - Ensure architectural consistency across implementations
   - Provide technical guidance when agents encounter obstacles
   - Make critical design decisions when needed

### Task Status Categories

- ‚è±Ô∏è **NOT STARTED**: Task has been defined but work has not begun
- üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**: Work has started but is not complete
- üö´ **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to external dependencies
- üëÄ **READY FOR REVIEW**: Implementation complete, awaiting review
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Approved and integrated into the project

### Priority Levels

- üö® **CRITICAL**: Security issues, blocking bugs, or deployment emergencies
- üî¥ **HIGH**: Core functionality, features on critical path
- üü° **MEDIUM**: Important features not on critical path
- üü¢ **LOW**: Nice-to-have features, optimizations, refactoring

## Frontend-Backend Interaction

1. **API Communication**
   - Backend exposes RESTful endpoints at `/api/`
   - Frontend services in `core/services/` make HTTP requests to these endpoints
   - JWT tokens handle authentication via Authorization headers
   - Example: `authentication.service.ts` makes requests to `/api/auth/login`

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSockets via Socket.IO provide real-time notifications
   - Client connects in `realtime-dashboard.service.ts`
   - Server emits events from domain services
   - Events are authenticated via JWT
   - Redis adapter used for scaling in production

3. **Error Handling**
   - Backend sends standardized error responses
   - Frontend has global error interceptor and notification service
   - Consistent error format: `{ success: false, message, statusCode, errors, code }`

## Development Workflow

### Backend Development

1. **Starting the server**:
   ```bash
   cd finance-dashboard-backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   npm test
   
   # Run specific test suite
   npm run test:unit
   npm run test:integration
   
   # API endpoint testing
   node run-all-api-tests.js
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
   - Use different MongoDB databases for dev/test/prod

### Frontend Development

1. **Starting the Angular app**:
   ```bash
   cd finance-dashboard-frontend
   npm install
   ng serve
   ```

2. **Testing**:
   ```bash
   ng test
   ```

## Project-Specific Conventions

1. **API Response Format**:
   - All API responses follow the pattern: `{ success, message, data, statusCode, timestamp, [meta] }`
   - Error responses include: `{ success: false, message, statusCode, errors, code }`

2. **Authentication**:
   - JWT-based with access and refresh tokens
   - Token blacklist handled via Redis (or in-memory fallback)
   - Auth middleware in both HTTP and WebSocket connections

3. **Business Logic**:
   - Core logic belongs in service layer, not controllers
   - Controllers should be thin and handle request/response only
   - Follow service-repository pattern for data access

4. **Frontend State Management**:
   - Use NgRx for global state (auth, transactions, budgets, etc.)
   - Use component state for UI-specific concerns
   - Follow action/reducer/selector pattern

## Common Development Tasks

1. **Adding a new API endpoint**:
   - Add route in appropriate `routes/*.routes.js` file
   - Create controller method in `controllers/*.controller.js`
   - Implement business logic in `services/*.service.js`
   - Add input validation schema if needed

2. **Adding a new Angular feature**:
   - Generate components with `ng generate component features/[feature]/[name]`
   - Create services with `ng generate service core/services/[name]`
   - Update state management if needed (actions, effects, reducers)
   - Add routes to module routing file

## Debugging Tips

1. **Backend Issues**:
   - Check logs in `logs/` directory
   - Use `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for detailed logging
   - API testing page available at `/socket-test.html`

2. **Frontend Issues**:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Use Redux DevTools for state debugging
   - Enable source maps in production for better error tracking

## Testing Strategy

1. **Backend Testing**:
   - Unit tests with Jest for services and utility functions
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Manual testing with the socket-test.html page for real-time features

2. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Unit tests with Karma for services and components
   - End-to-end testing with Protractor

## Deployment Considerations

- Backend uses PM2 for process management
- Environment-specific configs in `config/` directory
- Redis needed for production WebSockets and token blacklisting
- Different MongoDB databases should be used for dev/test/prod environments

## Contextual Awareness

When working on this codebase, prioritize reading any `Flow.md` files in the current directory or parent directories. These files may contain more specific guidance that supersedes these general instructions.

## Problem-Solving Approach (Orchestrator Workflow)

1. **Understand the Request** - Clarify requirements before implementing
2. **Consult Context** - Check relevant documentation and code
3. **Plan** - Break down complex tasks into discrete, manageable sub-tasks
4. **Assign** - Distribute tasks to coding agents via COMMUNICATION.md
5. **Monitor** - Track progress and provide guidance through regular check-ins
6. **Review** - Conduct thorough code reviews against project standards
7. **Approve** - Validate deliverables and integrate completed work
8. **Document** - Update project documentation and communicate outcomes

## Code Review Standards (Orchestrator)

### Review Criteria

1. **Functionality**: Does the code work as specified?
2. **Architecture**: Does it follow project patterns and conventions?
3. **Performance**: Are there any efficiency concerns?
4. **Security**: Are there potential vulnerabilities?
5. **Maintainability**: Is the code clean and well-documented?
6. **Testing**: Is there adequate test coverage?

### Review Feedback Format

```
üéØ ORCHESTRATOR ‚Üí AGENT [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
Task: [Task ID]
Action: REVIEW

Overall Assessment:
[General impression of the implementation]

Required Changes:
- [Filename]: [Description of required change]
- [Filename]: [Description of required change]

Suggestions:
- [Optional improvements that could be made]

Questions:
- [Any questions about implementation decisions]
```

### Exception Handling

**Blocked Tasks:**
- Agent immediately updates status to BLOCKED
- Orchestrator works to resolve or reassigns priority
- May assign alternative tasks in the interim

**Scope Changes:**
- Orchestrator creates formal scope change notice
- Adjusts timelines and deliverables accordingly
- Documents reasons for change

**Technical Disagreements:**
- Document options with pros and cons
- Focus on project goals rather than preferences
- Orchestrator makes final decisions while respecting Agent expertise

## Task Management Workflow

For any multi-step task, use the following workflow to manage work effectively:

### Step 1: Choose Tracking Method

At the beginning of a new task, ask for the preferred tracking method:

1. **GitHub Issues (Preferred):** Ask for the repository owner and name (e.g., `spanexx/personal-finance-dashboard`). This is recommended for collaborative and version-controlled projects.
2. **Local `TASKS.md` File (Fallback):** If a repository isn't provided or a simpler method is preferred, use a `TASKS.md` file in the project's root directory.

### Step 2: Execution

* **If using GitHub Issues:**
  * Create a new issue for the task
  * Include a checklist of sub-tasks in the issue description
  * Reference the issue number in commits and pull requests
  * Update the issue with comments and close upon completion
  * **Example:** For a task "Refactor Auth", create issue #42 with a title and checklist

* **If using `TASKS.md`:**
  * Create or update the `TASKS.md` file in the project's root
  * Use Markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]`) for the task list
  * Update the file to reflect the current status of each task (`[ ]`, `[>]`, `[x]`)

This approach ensures that task management is both powerful and adaptable to the specific needs of this finance dashboard project.
