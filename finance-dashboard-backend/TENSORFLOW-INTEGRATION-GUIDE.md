# TensorFlow.js Integration Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue

When attempting to run the server with our ML implementation, we're encountering the following error:

```
Error: The specified module could not be found.
\\?\C:\Users\shuga\OneDrive\Desktop\PRO\FINANCE\personal-finance-dashboard\finance-dashboard-backend\node_modules\@tensorflow\tfjs-node\lib\napi-v8\tfjs_binding.node
```

This indicates a problem with the native bindings for TensorFlow.js, which are required for the Node.js integration.

## Temporary Solution

I've implemented a temporary workaround with the following components:

1. **server-no-ml.js**: A modified server entry point that sets `global.ML_DISABLED = true` to bypass TensorFlow functionality.

2. **tf-loader.js**: A utility that safely attempts to load TensorFlow.js without crashing the application if it fails.

3. **Conditional route handling in app.js**: Routes that depend on ML functionality return a friendly error when ML is disabled.

4. **Modified prediction.service.js**: Uses the safe loader to avoid crashes.

To run the server without ML functionality:

```bash
npm run dev:no-ml
```

## Required Permanent Solution

### 1. Node.js Version Compatibility

Our current Node.js version (v22.14.0) may be too recent for the available TensorFlow.js bindings. Research is needed to:

- Determine which version of Node.js is compatible with TensorFlow.js
- Consider downgrading Node.js to a supported version OR
- Find a compatible version of TensorFlow.js for our Node version

### 2. System Requirements

TensorFlow.js Node.js integration requires:

- Python (for the build process)
- Visual Studio Build Tools (on Windows)
- Other platform-specific dependencies

Document these requirements and include them in the project setup instructions.

### 3. Graceful Degradation

Enhance the temporary solution to make it a robust fallback mechanism:

- Improve error detection and reporting
- Provide meaningful messages to users when ML features are unavailable
- Add a configuration option to explicitly enable/disable ML features

### 4. Alternative Approaches

Consider these alternatives if TensorFlow.js integration remains problematic:

- Create a separate ML microservice with compatible dependencies
- Use a cloud-based ML service instead of local processing
- Use a different ML library with better Node.js compatibility

## Testing Requirements

Once a solution is implemented:

- Test ML functionality on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Document any platform-specific setup instructions
- Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Documentation

Update project documentation to include:

- ML system requirements
- Setup instructions for different operating systems
- Troubleshooting steps for common issues
- Performance considerations and resource requirements
