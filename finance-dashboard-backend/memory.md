# Memory - Backend

This file contains my notes and observations about the backend of the Personal Finance Dashboard project.

## Initial Observations

*   The backend is a well-structured Node.js application.
*   It uses Express.js as the web framework and MongoDB as the database.
*   It has a clear separation of concerns, with different directories for controllers, services, models, etc.
*   It uses JWT for authentication and has a good set of security middleware.
*   It uses Socket.io for real-time communication.
*   It has a good test suite, with both unit and integration tests.

## Open Questions

*   What is the purpose of the `server-minimal.js` file?
*   What is the current status of the Redis and WebSocket implementation?
*   What is the plan for the `transaction-refactor-progress.md` and `transactionControlProgress.md` files?
