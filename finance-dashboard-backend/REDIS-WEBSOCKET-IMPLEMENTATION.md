# Redis Token Blacklist and WebSocket Integration

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Token Blacklist Implementation

- Fixed duplicated `cleanupExpiredTokens()` method in the `TokenBlacklist` class
- Added proper Redis integration for token blacklist storage
- Implemented graceful fallback to in-memory storage when Redis is unavailable
- Added async token verification methods

### 2. Updated Auth Middleware

- Modified `auth.middleware.js` to use async token verification methods
- Ensured proper handling of asynchronous token blacklist checks
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

### 3. Enhanced Server Shutdown Process

- Added proper Redis connection cleanup in server shutdown handlers
- Implemented graceful shutdown for MongoDB connections
- Added proper error handling for shutdown processes

### 4. Added Redis Configuration

- Updated `.env` file with Redis configuration for token blacklist
- Added specific Redis settings for token blacklist storage
- Configured Redis connection parameters for production environment

### 5. WebSocket Testing

- Added integration tests for WebSocket functionality
- Created a test page for manual WebSocket testing
- Ensured Socket.IO authentication with JWT tokens

## Implementation Details

### Token Blacklist with Redis

The token blacklist implementation now uses Redis in production environments for better performance and scalability. Key features:

1. **Automatic Fallback**: If Redis is unavailable, the system automatically falls back to in-memory storage
2. **TTL-based Expiration**: Token blacklist entries in Redis automatically expire based on token expiration time
3. **Async Operations**: All token blacklist operations are now asynchronous to support Redis

### WebSocket Security

WebSocket connections are secured using the same JWT authentication mechanism as the REST API:

1. **Authentication Middleware**: Socket connections require a valid JWT token
2. **User-specific Rooms**: Each authenticated user joins a room specific to their user ID
3. **Access Control**: Events can be targeted to specific users or groups of users
4. **Namespace Protection**: WebSocket endpoints are protected against unauthorized access

## Testing

To test the WebSocket implementation:

1. Start the server with `npm start`
2. Open `http://localhost:5000/socket-test.html` in your browser
3. Log in through the API to get a valid JWT token
4. Enter the token in the test page and connect
5. Send and receive events to verify functionality

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to production with Redis configuration
2. Monitor token blacklist performance in production
3. Add additional WebSocket event handlers for real-time features
4. Implement automatic reconnection and token refresh for WebSocket clients
