## Personal Finance Dashboard Application

Develop a full-stack personal finance dashboard application enabling users to log income and expenses, visualize spending patterns, manage savings goals, and gain financial insights. The application must follow a component-based, MVC-style architecture for modularity and maintainability.

Frontend (Angular): Build an interactive dashboard using Angular. Utilize Angular Material components for a consistent design and theming. Implement forms using Reactive Forms for adding and editing financial data. Display data using Material tables and cards. Visualize spending and financial trends using charts (bar, pie, line) via Chart.js (integrated with ng2-charts). Manage application state using an NgRx store for predictable data flow of budgets, transactions, and goals, employing actions, reducers, and selectors. Ensure the UI is fully responsive and accessible across all devices, adhering to design best practices including consistent color schemes, clear typography, and intuitive layouts. Integrate with the backend API using Angular's HttpClient and RxJS, handling loading states and errors gracefully with appropriate user feedback.

Backend (Node.js): Develop a Node.js backend using Express . Implement a REST API with secure endpoints for user authentication and financial data management (e.g., /api/transactions, /api/goals). Persist user data (budgets, expenses, goals) in a chosen database (MongoDB). Implement JWT-based authentication to secure API routes and protect sensitive user data.

Testing: Write comprehensive unit tests (Jasmine/Karma) for Angular components, services, and utility functions. Implement end-to-end tests (Cypress or Protractor) to simulate critical user flows such as login, adding an expense, and verifying dashboard updates, focusing testing efforts on key functionality rather than arbitrary coverage percentages.

Optional Advanced Features: Implement additional chart types for deeper analytics (e.g., savings over time). Add functionality for file upload (e.g., bank statements, receipts) to the Node server. Enable exporting financial reports (CSV/PDF). Implement real-time updates using WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) for multi-device synchronization. Enhance security with OAuth or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Refine UI/UX with clear error messages and robust form validation feedback.
