# TransactionListComponent Refactoring Tasks

## Overview
The current TransactionListComponent (800+ lines) handles too many responsibilities including filtering, bulk operations, export/import, and data display. This refactoring plan will break it down into smaller, more maintainable components and improve state management.

## Phase 1: Create Transaction Facade Service ✓

- [x] Create TransactionFacadeService to abstract NgRx interactions
- [x] Move store selections and dispatches from component to facade
- [x] Update TransactionListComponent to use the facade

## Phase 2: Extract Filter Component ✓

- [x] Create TransactionFiltersComponent
  - [x] Move filter form structure and methods
  - [x] Implement Input/Output for component communication
  - [x] Handle accessibility features for filters
- [x] Update TransactionListComponent to use the filter component
- [ ] Add tests for TransactionFiltersComponent (TODO)

## Phase 3: Extract Transaction Table Component ✓

- [x] Create TransactionTableComponent
  - [x] Extract table display logic and templates
  - [x] Implement trackBy and virtual scrolling
  - [x] Handle keyboard navigation
- [x] Update TransactionListComponent to use table component
- [ ] Add tests for TransactionTableComponent (TODO)

## Phase 4: Extract Bulk Operations Component ✓

- [x] Create TransactionBulkOperationsComponent
  - [x] Move selection logic and bulk action methods
  - [x] Implement Input/Output for component communication
- [x] Update TransactionListComponent to use bulk operations component
- [ ] Add tests for TransactionBulkOperationsComponent (TODO)

## Phase 5: Extract Export/Import Component ✓

- [x] Create TransactionExportImportComponent
  - [x] Move export/import related functionality
  - [x] Handle format selection and dialog interactions
- [x] Update TransactionListComponent to use export/import component
- [ ] Add tests for TransactionExportImportComponent (TODO)

## Phase 6: Extract Transaction Statistics Component ✓

- [x] Create TransactionStatisticsComponent
  - [x] Move statistics calculation and display
  - [x] Add reactive updates based on filtered data
- [x] Update TransactionListComponent to use statistics component
- [ ] Add tests for TransactionStatisticsComponent (TODO)

## Phase 7: Refactor TransactionListComponent ✓

- [x] Clean up remaining code in TransactionListComponent
- [x] Implement proper communication between extracted components
- [ ] Update component tests to reflect new structure (TODO)

## Phase 8: Enhance Facade Pattern ✓

- [x] Implement better error handling in facade
- [x] Add caching mechanism for frequently accessed data
- [x] Create selector factories for common data transformations

## Phase 9: Documentation and Polish ✓

- [x] Add inline documentation for all components
- [x] Create usage examples for reusable components
- [x] Add performance optimizations where needed
