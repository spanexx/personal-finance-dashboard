# Transaction Import/Export Implementation Task

## Overview
This task involves implementing the import and export functionality for transactions in the personal finance dashboard application.

## Background
The transaction list component has UI elements for import and export functionality, but they are not fully implemented. The backend already has a comprehensive API for handling import/export operations, but the frontend needs to integrate with these endpoints.

## Current Status
- **Backend**: Complete API with controllers, routes, and services for export/import
- **Frontend**: UI components exist but functionality not implemented

## Tasks

### 1. Create Export/Import Service (Frontend)
- [ ] Create a new service `ExportImportService` in `src/app/core/services/export-import.service.ts`
- [ ] Implement methods to interact with backend export/import API endpoints

### 2. Implement Export Functionality
- [ ] Update `exportTransactions()` method in transaction-list component
- [ ] Connect to backend export API
- [ ] Handle different export formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)
- [ ] Add progress indication for large exports
- [ ] Implement export of selected transactions

### 3. Implement Import Functionality
- [ ] Create import dialog component
- [ ] Implement file upload mechanism
- [ ] Add validation for imported files
- [ ] Connect to backend import API
- [ ] Show import progress and results
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully

### 4. Add Import/Export History
- [ ] Create a component to display export/import history
- [ ] Connect to backend history API endpoints
- [ ] Allow downloading of previously exported files

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for new service and components
- [ ] Test all export formats
- [ ] Test different import scenarios (valid file, invalid file, etc.)
- [ ] Test with large datasets

### 6. UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add loading indicators during import/export operations
- [ ] Improve error messaging
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for potentially destructive import operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can export transactions in various formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)
- Users can import transactions from compatible files
- The UI provides clear feedback during and after import/export operations
- Error handling is robust and user-friendly
- Previously exported files can be downloaded from history

## Technical Notes
- Backend API is available at `/api/export-import/`
- File upload should use the existing upload middleware
- Consider implementing streaming for large exports
