## Code Review Process for AI Implementation Tasks

When reviewing AI implementation tasks from the coding agent, follow this strict process:

1. **Verify All Claimed Files Exist**: Check that every file the coding agent claims to have created or modified actually exists.

2. **Code Quality Assessment**: Review each file for:
   - Proper implementation of requested features
   - Appropriate use of ML libraries
   - Adherence to project's coding standards
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Proper documentation and comments

3. **Integration Verification**: Confirm that new components are properly integrated with existing code:
   - Routes are correctly registered in app.js
   - Services are properly imported and used
   - Dependencies are correctly added to package.json

4. **Functional Testing Requirements**:
   - ML models should have evaluation metrics
   - Training processes should be documented
   - Feature extraction logic should be robust

5. **Documentation Review**:
   - All ML components should be documented
   - System architecture should be clearly explained
   - Usage instructions should be provided

6. **Be Strict About Completion**: Only mark tasks as complete when they fully satisfy all requirements. If any aspect is missing or incomplete, provide specific feedback on what needs improvement.

Remember: As the manager, the definition of "done" is your responsibility. Ensure that all AI implementations are production-ready before approval.
