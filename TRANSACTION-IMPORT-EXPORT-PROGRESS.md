# Transaction Import/Export Implementation Progress Report

## Completed Work

1. **Backend API Analysis**:
   - Analyzed the existing backend API for export/import functionality
   - Confirmed that the backend API is comprehensive and ready for integration

2. **Frontend Service Creation**:
   - Created `ExportImportService` in core/services to interact with the backend API
   - Implemented all methods for export, import, validation, and history

3. **Import Dialog Component**:
   - Created `ImportDialogComponent` for handling file uploads
   - Implemented multi-step import process with validation and options
   - Added styling and error handling

4. **Transaction List Integration**:
   - Updated `TransactionListComponent` to use the new service
   - Implemented `exportTransactions` method with support for different formats
   - Implemented `openImportDialog` method to launch the import dialog
   - Added utility methods for date range extraction

5. **HttpClient Service Enhancement**:
   - Added `getBlob` method to support file downloads

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Testing the Implementation**:
   - Test the export functionality with different formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)
   - Test the import functionality with sample files
   - Verify that exported data can be reimported
   - Test edge cases like large files, invalid formats, etc.

2. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Add more robust error handling for network failures
   - Implement retry logic for large file uploads

3. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Add more detailed progress indicators for large imports/exports
   - Improve validation feedback for import files
   - Add tooltips and help text for import options

4. **History View**:
   - Create a component to view export/import history
   - Add ability to re-download previously exported files

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update user documentation with import/export instructions
   - Document supported file formats and field mappings
   - Create example templates for users to download

## Next Steps

1. Test the basic implementation to ensure it works as expected
2. Implement the history view component
3. Address any bugs or issues found during testing
4. Enhance the UI/UX based on user feedback

## Notes
- The backend API appears to be well-designed and should support all required functionality
- The export service allows for both client-side CSV generation and server-side processing for other formats
- The import dialog provides a step-by-step process to guide users through the import process
